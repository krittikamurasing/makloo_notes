# Carboanions

- Geometry of carboanion is tetrahedral and hybridisation is $sp^3$ because the steric number is 4.

#### Stability of carboanions

Addition of alkyl groups decreases the stability because it increases the electron density.

# Carbocations

- Hybridization of carbon will be $sp^2$ and its shape is trigonal planar.

Addition of alkyl groups increases with increase in alkyl groups.

## Acidic strength of craboxylic acids and phenols

Acidic strength increases when -I groups are present.

##### Example:-
(a) Acidic strength increases with increase in the number of electron withdrawing flourine atoms:

(b) HCOOH is stronger acid than $CH3COOH$ since the -CH3 group destabilizes the carboxylate ion.

## Basic strength of amines

Electron-donating group like alkyl group increase the basic strength of amines, whereas electron withdrawing groups like aryl groups decrease the basic nature.
